Barebones network ping utility for iOS and macOS.
Based mostly off the ping portion of [Ubiquiti WiFiman](https://blog.ui.com/2018/12/11/introducing-wifiman/) because I found myself using it so often.

**Status:** macOS: ✅, iOS: ✅

Note: Name may change and this is not in the app store at this point.
